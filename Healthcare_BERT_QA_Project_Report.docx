Healthcare BERT QA System Project Report

Abstract:
The Healthcare BERT QA System is an intelligent question-answering platform designed to assist users with medical queries by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and domain-specific knowledge. The system integrates BioBERT, a biomedical language model, with a curated medical knowledge base and document upload functionality, enabling users to receive accurate, context-aware answers to healthcare-related questions. The solution provides both a RESTful API and a user-friendly Streamlit web interface for seamless interaction.

Implementation:
- Backend: Python Flask API (enhanced_full_api.py) serving endpoints for medical Q&A, document upload, and health checks.
- NLP Engine: BioBERT model and pattern-matching logic for extracting answers from both the knowledge base and user-uploaded documents.
- Frontend: Streamlit app (frontend/streamlit_app.py) for interactive Q&A, document upload, and visualization.
- Document Handling: Users can upload medical documents (TXT, MD) which are indexed and searched for relevant information.
- Error Handling: Robust exception management and status reporting for both API and frontend.
- Extensibility: Modular design allows easy integration of new models, data sources, and UI features.

Conclusion:
The Healthcare BERT QA System demonstrates the power of combining deep learning models with curated domain knowledge for practical, real-world medical applications. The system is robust, extensible, and user-friendly, supporting both technical and non-technical users. Future enhancements may include more advanced document parsing, integration with external medical databases, and improved answer ranking.
